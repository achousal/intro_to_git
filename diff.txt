+Thus much let me avow--
+In a vision, or in none,
+O God! can I not save
+Thus much let me avow--
+Through my fingers to the deep,
+O God! can I not grasp
 I stand amid the roar
-Them with a tighter clasp?

-Take this kiss upon the brow!
-Of a surf-tormented shore,

+In a vision, or in none,
+Is but a dream within a dream.
+You are not wrong, who deem
+And I hold within my hand
+In a night, or in a day,
+Is but a dream within a dream.

-Through my fingers to the deep,
-All that we see or seem
-Grains of the golden sand--
-All that we see or seem
-All that we see or seem
-How few! yet how they creep
-Is all that we see or seem
-O God! can I not save
