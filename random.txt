Thus much let me avow--
In a vision, or in none,
O God! can I not save
Thus much let me avow--
Through my fingers to the deep,
O God! can I not grasp
I stand amid the roar
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow--
In a night, or in a day,
That my days have been a dream;
Is but a dream within a dream.
In a vision, or in none,
Is but a dream within a dream.
You are not wrong, who deem
And I hold within my hand
In a night, or in a day,
Is but a dream within a dream.
Them with a tighter clasp?
While I weep--while I weep!
And, in parting from you now,
You are not wrong, who deem
And I hold within my hand
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Grains of the golden sand--
