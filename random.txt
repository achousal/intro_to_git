Take this kiss upon the brow!
Them with a tighter clasp?
I stand amid the roar
Them with a tighter clasp?
Is it therefore the less gone?
One from the pitiless wave?
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And, in parting from you now,
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Them with a tighter clasp?
Through my fingers to the deep,
All that we see or seem
Grains of the golden sand--
All that we see or seem
All that we see or seem
How few! yet how they creep
Is all that we see or seem
O God! can I not save
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Yet if hope has flown away
